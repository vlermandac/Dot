Jan 27 22:06:50.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 30% (loading_status): Loading networkstatus consensus
Jan 27 22:06:51.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We have no usable consensus.
Jan 27 22:06:51.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 40% (loading_keys): Loading authority key certs
Jan 27 22:06:52.000 [warn] Our clock is 2 hours, 53 minutes behind the time published in the consensus network status document (2021-01-28 04:00:00 UTC).  Tor needs an accurate clock to work correctly. Please check your time and date settings!
Jan 27 22:06:52.000 [warn] Received microdesc flavor consensus with skewed time (CONSENSUS): It seems that our clock is behind by 2 hours, 53 minutes, or that theirs is ahead. Tor requires an accurate clock to work: please check your time, timezone, and date settings.
Jan 27 22:06:52.000 [warn] Problem bootstrapping. Stuck at 40% (loading_keys): Loading authority key certs. (Clock skew -10388 in microdesc flavor consensus from CONSENSUS; CLOCK_SKEW; count 1; recommendation warn; host ? at ?)
Jan 27 22:06:52.000 [notice] The current consensus has no exit nodes. Tor can only build internal paths, such as paths to onion services.
Jan 27 22:06:52.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 45% (requesting_descriptors): Asking for relay descriptors
Jan 27 22:06:52.000 [notice] I learned some more directory information, but not enough to build a circuit: We need more microdescriptors: we have 0/6853, and can only build 0% of likely paths. (We have 0% of guards bw, 0% of midpoint bw, and 0% of end bw (no exits in consensus, using mid) = 0% of path bw.)
Jan 27 22:06:53.000 [notice] Bootstrapped 50% (loading_descriptors): Loading relay descriptors
Jan 27 22:06:54.000 [notice] The current consensus contains exit nodes. Tor can build exit and internal paths.
